In 1978 - C programming by Dennis Ritchie

Which follows Procedural Language

Drawbacks: 1) Not good for handling memory
2) No Exception Handling
3) It doesn't follow OOPS paradigm

In 1979 - C++ Programming by Bjarne Stroustrip

Drawbacks: 1) Pointers
2) Operator overloading virtual function 
3) No platform independent

In 1991 - Python Programming 

In 1995 - JAVA Programming by James Gosling

History of JAVA starts from the Green Team
Java has named by JavaBeams in Indonesia

Java Features:
1) Simple (Already learned C & C++)
2) Robust(meaning powerful) --> Error Prone Code
3) Platform Independent
	--> JDK is platform independent
	--> JVM is platform dependent
4) It follows OPPS paradigm but no 100%. Simula is considered as the First OOPS Language. 

Flow:
filename.java ---> compiler ---> filename.class

JDK ---> JAVA Development Kit
JVM ---> JAVA Virtual Machine
JIT ---> Just In Time Interpreter (double check the bytecode)
OOPS ---> Object Oriented Programming System
POP ---> Procedural Oriented Programming

J2SE ---> JAVA 2 Standard Edition
J2EE ---> JAVA 2 Enterprise Edition
J2ME ---> JAVA 2 Micro Edition



OOPS For Every Programming Language:
4 Pillars:
	1) Encapsulation
	2) Polymorphism
	3) Inheritance
	4) Abstraction

5) Good in Memory Management
	--> Garbage Collector
6) It is Multi threaded Language
7) It Handles Exception Handling
8) Distributed Language
	--> For Developing Web Applications, Embedded System, TCP/TP Protocals
	
9) It is Portable

GIT & GITHUB:
1) To Initialize --> git inti (local storage)
